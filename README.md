## Using statistics to analyze MPG
### With our given dataset, we were able to perform a multiple linear regression to predict the impact certain vehicle factors such as vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, adn drivetrain (AWD). Based on the summary statistics below, we were able to determine variables with non-random variances affected our mpg such vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and drivetrain. Those variables had a p-value greater than .05 Our other variables such vehicle length, and ground clearance were statistically significant with a p-value < .05, indicating they had no significant impact on mpg.
